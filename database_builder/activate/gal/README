Here are the stellar+gas templates that I plotted last time (columns are wavelength in \AA and luminosity in L_{\lambda}/L_{\sun}). Let me know if you need any other info about these models. Four are quiescent and seven are star-forming galaxies.

Please remember that these spectra are not publicly available, so they should not be shared and they should be used only for this project. For details, you can refer to my 2012 paper. Thanks!
